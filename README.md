## 🕊️ About

I go by the pen name **Trgr** or **Trgr KarasuToragara**.

This is a personal initiative that bridges **AI ethics** in both theory and implementation:
- 🧠 Theory on [Academia.edu](https://independent.academia.edu/TrgrKarasuToragara)
- 🛠️ Prototypes on [GitHub](https://github.com/trgr-karasutoragara)

With a background in the **call center industry**, I care deeply about **hospitality**, **user safety**, and especially **preventive system design**.

With a background in the **call center industry**, I care deeply about **hospitality**, **user safety**, and especially **preventive system design**.

Since I carry out both the theoretical design and practical implementation on my own, I have no need to rely on external funding.  
This allows me to build prototypes even in areas where budgets are hard to obtain, such as **education** and **welfare**.

I aim to craft tools that empower the next generation.
